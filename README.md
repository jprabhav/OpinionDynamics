# OpinionDynamics

This notebook presents a multi-layered simulation of opinion dynamics using two complementary approaches:

    - Expected Utility Model: This model is based on game heory where actors with position, salience and capability strategically influence others.
    - Opinion Dynamics: This model is based on statistical mechanics where the players' pinions evolve via local majority influence.
    - Hybrid Model: Combines both paradigms with strong influencers and a social network structure.

We consider a toy example of vaccine mandates in some hypothetical country. As expected, people can be pro-vaccination or anti-vaccination or just undecided. The notebook explores how opinions form, shift, and stabilize in different conditions for this example. We study, given the choice to buy an insurance policy, how such a population would behave with time. We analyse the agent's behaviour and how the network structure influences their decision buy and potentially renew insurance policies.
